Git is used for software development projects.
Git is a DevOps tool 
It is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.
It supports rapid branching and merging.
First topic covered is about perfect commit.
It have 2 parts . one is right changes and the a\other part is good commit message.
so a good commit should be separated equally.
The perfect commit message has a body and a subject
Int hat subject has a summary of what happened and the body has more detailed explanation.
second topic is about BRANCHING STRATEGIES.
It has written conventions, Integrating changes and structure releases.
Integrating changes has mainline development which is mainly integrating.
Feature Branches are of two types. ie , Long Running and Short Lived Branches.
Long running exixt for the comlete lifecycle of the project. It has no direct commits.
Short lived is used for new features,bug fixes , etc,..
it can be deleted after integration ie, after merge/rebase.
Example for Branching strategies are:
GitHub Flow and GitFlow
Third topic is Pull requests.
It is used for communicating and reviewing about code.
It can be used to contribute code to other repositories also.
Fourth topic covered is merge conflicts.
When integrating commits from different sources conflicts occur.
Integrating is not only limited for merging branches.
for a flawless process, when contradictory changes happen merging changes can be done in git.
We can also undo and start a new conflict aswell.
Conflicts are just a character file.
Conflict can be solved by simply cleaning up the file.
Merge vs rebase is the last topic about.
